**Is predatory publishing a real threat? Evidence from a large database study**

Using a database of predatory journals and publications, we look into the extent that (allegedly) predatory publications are present in the Brazilian academy. Based on a massive amount of publications from Brazilian researchers of all disciplines during the 2000 to 2015 period, we were able to analyze the extent of predatory publications using econometric modeling. Descriptive statistics suggest that predatory publications represent a small proportion, but have seen an exponential growth of participation in the last 5 years. Experienced researchers with a Ph.D. obtained locally are more likely to publish in predatory journals. Further analysis shows that once a  journal regarded as predatory is ranked in the local ranking system, Qualis, it starts to receive more publications than non-predatory ones. [Full Text]



**Accessing Financial Reports and Corporate Events Data from B3 using GetDFPData**

GetDFPData is an open and free software for accessing data from B3, the Brazilian financial exchange.  Users can import large datasets of financial reports and corporate events from traded companies with a web or command line interface. Designing and popularizing free software for gathering and managing data can boost the number and quality of research in financial markets. This paper discusses the use and contribution of the proposed software. Three empirical and reproducible examples of usage in corporate finance research are presented.
