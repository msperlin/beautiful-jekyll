## ACD Models

This package includes functions and scripts for the estimation and simulation of ACD (autoregressive conditional duration) models. 
  
The zip file includes: 
  
- Scripts and functions for Estimation of an ACD(q,p) model with exponential or weibull distribution 
- Scripts and functions for Simulation of an ACD(q,p) model with exponential or weibull distribution 
- Scripts for cool plots/movies of weibull, burr and generalized gamma distributions. 
- Scripts and functions for visualizing the log likelihood space of the model (the figure showed above) 

Required Products: Statistics, Optimization
