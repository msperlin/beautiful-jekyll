My name is Marcelo. I live in city of Porto Alegre, south of Brazil and I work as an assistant professor of Finance in Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). I received my PhD in Finance from Reading University (ICMA Centre, UK) in 2010 and I have a substantial experience creating computer scripts for applied research in Finance. You can find more details about my past and current work in my [personal homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/marceloperlin/).

In this blog I will write about my CRAN packages and any other ideas about finance and R or research papers that I'm currently working on. The content, however, will be mostly about R.

Got a question? Fell free to drop me an email at [marceloperlin@gmail.com](marceloperlin@gmail.com).

Enjoy!
