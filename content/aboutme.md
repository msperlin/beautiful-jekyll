My name is Marcelo and I live in the city of Porto Alegre, south of Brazil. I work as an assistant professor of Finance at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). I received my PhD in Finance from Reading University (ICMA Centre, UK) in 2010 and I have a substantial experience creating computer scripts for applied research in Finance. You can find more details about my past and current work in tabs **Research** and **Code**. My CV is available [here](/content/cv/CV_msperlin_Latex.pdf)

In my blog I will write about my CRAN packages and any other ideas about finance and R or research papers that I'm currently working on. The content, however, will be mostly about R.

Got a question? Fell free to drop me an email at [marceloperlin@gmail.com](marceloperlin@gmail.com).
