Programming is not only part of my job as an academic, but a big hobby for me. Over time, I developed many packages that are publicly distributed in CRAN. You can find the name and description below. Most of them are also hosted at [Github](https://github.com/msperlin/).

[PkgsFromFiles](https://github.com/msperlin/PkgsFromFiles) - Includes functions for finding and installing R packages by finding its use from local scripts and Rmarkdown/Sweave files. See [blog post](https://msperlin.github.io/2018-10-13-NewPackage-PkgsFromFiles/) for details.

[GetDFPData](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GetDFPData) - Reads annual financial reports including assets, liabilities, dividends history, stockholder composition and much more from Bovespa's DFP, FRE and FCA systems <http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/en_us/products/listed-equities-and-derivatives/equities/listed-companies.htm>. These are web based interfaces for all financial reports of companies traded at Bovespa. The package is especially designed for large scale data importation, keeping a tabular (long) structure for easier processing.


[GetHFData](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GetHFData) - Downloads and aggregates high frequency trading data for Brazilian instruments directly from Bovespa ftp site <ftp://ftp.bmf.com.br/MarketData/>.

[BatchGetSymbols](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BatchGetSymbols) - Makes it easy to download a large number of trade data from Yahoo or Google Finance.

[GetTDData](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GetTDData) - Downloads and aggregates data for Brazilian government issued bonds directly from the website of Tesouro Direto <http://www.tesouro.fazenda.gov.br/tesouro-direto-balanco-e-estatisticas>.

[GetLattesData](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GetLattesData) - A simple API for downloading and reading xml data directly from Lattes <http://lattes.cnpq.br/>.

[GetITRData](https://cran.r-project.org/package=) - Reads quarterly and annual financial reports including assets, liabilities, income and cash flow statements from Bovespa's ITR (informacoes trimestrais) system <http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/en_us/products/listed-equities-and-derivatives/equities/listed-companies.htm>. The ITR/DFP system is a web based interface for all financial reports of companies traded at Bovespa. The package is especially designed for large scale data importation, keeping a tabular (long) structure for easier processing.

[pafdR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pafdR) - Provides access to material from the book "Processing and Analyzing Financial Data with R" by Marcelo Perlin (2017) available at <https://sites.google.com/view/pafdr/home>.

[pmfdR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pmfdR) - Provides access to material from the book "Processing and Modelling Financial Data with R" by Marcelo Perlin (2017) available at <https://sites.google.com/view/pmfdr/home>.

[predatory](https://cran.r-project.org/package=predatory) - Allows the user to check and find (allegedly) predatory journals based on Beall's list available at <https://scholarlyoa.com/>. As part of a research project, the data from the website has been scraped with web scraping algorithms and manual work. The package includes a search function and direct access to this database of predatory journals. The use of this tool should facilitate the detection of predatory publications by researchers and librarians.

[RndTexExams](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RndTexExams) - Using as input a 'LaTeX' file with a multiple choice exam, this package will produce several versions with randomized contents of the same exam. Functions for grading and testing for cheating are also available.
