In 2007 I wrote a [Matlab package]() for estimating regime switching models. I was learning how to properly code and this project was my way of doing it. After publishing in FEX (Matlab file exchange site) I got so many repeated questions on my email that eventually I realized that it would be easier to write a manual for people to read or be referenced. I would spend some time writing it, but less time replying to repeated questions on my email. I wrote a [manual]() about the code and it became, by far, my most cited paper and most accessed paper in SSRN.

My experience tells me that my impact as a researcher is much higher when writing packages

- *The paper is NOT an extended manual*.
- *Make sure you know what's available.*
- *A bibliometric study is mandatory*.
- *A problem must be clearly stated*
- *Not everyone uses R, so make it easier for people  to use you software*
- *Think about your example of usage*
- *It is all worth it*.
