While I would like to post a success story about the Brazilian post office using R to analyze its internal data, the real story is the use of R's logo for its **R**egistered mail :). Have a look:

My best guess is that someone searched for R in [Google images](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=R&newwindow=1&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1p-2xws7YAhXGfpAKHQ0NDUoQ_AUICygC&biw=1920&bih=914) and used the first hit as a symbol of registered mail. My second best guess is that someone really likes R and was particularlly bored.
